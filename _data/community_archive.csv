I posted the photo to Instagram with no caption just because the idea of such a large formless snow sculpture made me smile and imagined this had been a fun project for a group of children. A day later, someone I didn’t know replied to the photo and let me know this was Mia the snow woman. ",4/6/2020,Bonnie Doon,236469316,,,,,,
