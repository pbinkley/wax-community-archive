label: Marquee of the Garneau Theatre saying it’s closed
description: going to the Garneau Theatre (or metro cinema) was one of my favourite
  activities but it’s been closed now since March 17 when Alberta Health started restricting
  mass gatherings. I drive by this sign a couple times a week and I appreciate how
  at the bottom they included “Take care of each other”.
