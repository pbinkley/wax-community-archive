description: 'I took this photo on walk the other day while on a walk to the Mill
  Creek Ravine. I posted the photo to Instagram with no caption just because the idea
  of such a large formless snow sculpture made me smile and imagined this had been
  a fun project for a group of children. A day later, someone I didnâ€™t know replied
  to the photo and let me know this was Mia the snow woman. '
