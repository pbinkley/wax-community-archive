It is not often that we can look around and recognize that an important historical event is unfolding before us. While the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are still unknown to us, it is clear that the way we live, as Albertans, has been dramatically affected. So many of us are taking pictures and videos to document these strange times, but the platforms and places we store these artifacts are fallible and fleeting. 

The University of Alberta Library wants to collect and preserve these community stories to document the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Alberta for future generations. We need your help. By contributing your photographs, videos, and audio stories to this community collection you will be able to contribute to the historic record. When scholars of the future look back on this time, they will know it through the images and artifacts we take the care to preserve. This is your chance to help share with future generations, what living through this pandemic was like. 

_Invitation for people to contribute with links to the forms._
