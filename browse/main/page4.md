It is not often that we see our world changing before our eyes, and recognize an important historical event is unfolding before us. The University of Alberta Library wants to collect and preserve the photos, videos and words that document these changes and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Alberta for future generations. It could be a photo you sent your friend of the empty store shelves or the chalk art on your nightly walk around the block, all of these tell a story worth saving.
