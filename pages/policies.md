In other words, you warrant that your contribution was created by you, it is wholly original, and it has not been copied from or based upon any other photographic, literary, or other work, except to the extent that such other material is in the public domain, or you have the permission of the copyright owner of that material, or your use of that material, including any use you are licensing under this agreement, is permitted under one or more of the exceptions under the Copyright Act. Additionally, you warrant that your contribution does not contain any libelous matter, nor invade any third party rights of privacy or publicity.  The University of Alberta Library reserves the right to take down or refuse any contribution.
