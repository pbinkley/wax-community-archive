**What are we looking for?**

- Any kind of digital content (photographic, audio or short video) that documents the impact of -the COVID-19 pandemic on your life. If you need inspiration, check out what has already been shared.  
- Your contribution has been created by you and does not infringe on any existing copyright.
- Your contribution does not provide personal information about you or any other individual including addresses, phone numbers, etc.

**Who can contribute?**  
The Alberta COVID-19 community is open to anyone from Alberta or if the content is about Alberta.

**How can I contribute?**

We’ve tried to make it easy to contribute and have set up a [Google form](https://forms.gle/X2KGaEPSj9VYGPEo8) to collect the files and the information about them. If you do not have a google account (or would rather not use one) feel free to [email us](mailto:sarah.severson@ualbert.ca) and we’ll figure out an alternate way for you to contribute.


The Google form will ask you:

- For your name and if you’d like your name to appear on the public website.
- To read and agree to our [contribution terms and conditions](/wax-community-archive/terms)  
- To upload your file and tell us a bit about it.
-- We’re asking you to give the file a short title that describes what it is.
-- Optionally to give us more of the background story. For example, we’d love to capture what the photo means to you, what made you stop and take it.
-- Tell us the region or neighbourhood where you took the photos so we can add them to the map.

The form lets you contribute one file at a time, but we encourage you to contribute as many times as you’d like. If you have a batch of files you’d like to contribute, [email us](mailto:digitization@ualbert.ca) and we’ll set up a different way to receive them.
